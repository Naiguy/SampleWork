************************************

Hello!
Thanks for reviewing my work!
I used Java for this exercise.

************************************
RUNNING THE APPLICATION
************************************

You can run this as any other java application if you create an executable.
You can edit any of the four input files.
The application will prompt for one of the four using their file names.
Files 1-3 are as are simple and will not require prompting.
File 4 is to show unfamiliar items and multiples of an item.

************************************
ASSUMPTIONS
************************************

Format for the file per line:
q item at price
where
q = an int
item = any string including spaces
at = the specific string "at"
price = any float/double in the form d.dd, meaning it has exactly 2 decimals.

************************************
NOTABLE POINTS
************************************

The included items, i.e "chocolate" and "perfume" are baked into the code to
speed up the process.

Otherwise, non-recognized items will prompt the user i.e input4.txt

A name of an imported item must include the substring "import" somewhere for it
to be considered imported by the app.

************************************
ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF APPLICATION
************************************

The application consists of 5 classes, and I divide responsibility as such:

* Calculator deals with all mathematical methods and the tax.

* Driver contains the main, instantiates most objects, and would be the facade.

* FileReadWriter deals with importing and interpretting the input files, including
turn them into items.

* Item is the only representative class. A traditional java object.

* Printer is the class that deals with output and String manipulation.
